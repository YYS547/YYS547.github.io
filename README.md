# FAQ
- **How much time do I get to finish the video?**  
Need to post within 1 week after reach agreement.  

- **Do I need to send a draft video for reviewing?**  
Yes, please send a draft video to the manager before posting. We usually will
not ask you to make big changes, it is only to make sure it is in the right way.
Which means:  
The video has to cover key features’ introduction, showing scrolling the
home page, the game detail page, playing at least one game, or playing with
a gamepad.

# Trying the app
- **Cannot play the game? Keep waiting in line?**  
Do not wait longer than 5 minutes. Just quit the game and re-open, or try
another game!

- **Do not have a game account?**  
We have “borrow an account” service, it is free, just choose it so that you
can borrow an account and play freely. Please show this feature in the videos
also.

- **It does not work?**  
Be patient, cloud game is a new technology, requires high speed and stable
network. Try using 5G or WIFI.

- **About iOS version**  
iOS version is just online, it is initial and not perfect. Please give it a few try
and welcome to share your feedback! It is updated every week so some
small bugs might be fixed very soon. Thank you for patient.

# Posting video
Should I upload it to the Tiktok Marketplace or post it as a normal video?
We recommend the Tiktok official marketplace, because it share the data
and protect both side. But it takes a few days for the platform to review the
video. And sometimes it just never pass the review… If cannot pass the
review, you can try just post it as a normal video, and do share the analysis
screenshots of your own.

- **Do I need to share video analyse?**  
Yes, please share screenshot of the video analysis, so that we can calculate
and analyse the business.

# Payment
- **How to pay?**  
Paypal is preferred. It is the easiest and quickest way, only requires your
name and PayPal account. It is instant transferring.
By bank. Need to provide your name, bank name, bank account, IBAN
number, SWIFT code. Which takes a few days for international transferring.

- **How long will I receive payment?**  
It has to go through the company’s process, multi departments have to
approve the payment application (we are not a small team), which might take
10 working days to finish it. But you will get paid! There are many videos out
there already with no complain from any creators, so no worry about it!

- **About payment date**  
The company’s financial team only do payments on Wednesday and Friday.
And they have a lot other stuff to do, they do not only work for marketing
team, so please be patient! It is just as slow as all the other companies.

# Alert: Fraud views will not get paid
For example, below situations (or similar):
1. Engagement rate lower than 3%. Data from Tiktok Marketplace (If
available). Engagement rate: Calculated as the sum of likes, comments and
shares divided by total views (Defined by Tiktok official)
2. Likes/Views < 4%
3. Audience are from a total irrelevant country. For example, your audience
are mainly from the US (data from tiktok marketplace), but the video’s views
are 90% from Finland.
