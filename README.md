# Posting video

We recommend the Tiktok official marketplace, because it share the data
and protect both side. But it takes a few days for the platform to review the

review, you can try just post it as a normal video, and do share the analysis
screenshots of your own.

By bank. Need to provide your name, bank name, bank account, IBAN
number, SWIFT code. Which takes a few days for international transferring.

- **How long will I receive payment?**  
It has to go through the company‚Äôs process, multi departments have to
approve the payment application (we are not a small team), which might take
10 working days to finish it. But you will get paid! There are many videos out
there already with no complain from any creators, so no worry about it!

- **About payment date**  
The company‚Äôs financial team only do payments on Wednesday and Friday.
And they have a lot other stuff to do, they do not only work for marketing
team, so please be patient! It is just as slow as all the other companies.
