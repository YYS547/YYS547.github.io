# INTRODUCTION

NetBoom is a cloud gaming service provider. It allows users to play PC games on their mobile devices. Like you can play GTAV, cyberpunk, fall guys on mobile. Users won't even need to download or
 buy the game, we have our account library to share with users which means people can get access
 to 100+ games for free with only 1 subscription.
